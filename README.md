## Assignment Description

This project contains an automation script to convert the move type to TypeScript types for further processing in Maven-SDK. The script converts the following move type:

```
// move type
struct CreateSigner {
    address: address,
}
```

into the following TypeScript type:

```
// TS type
type CreateSigner {
    address: SuiAddress,
}
```

Note the structure QueryID is defined as follows:

```
struct QueryID<T> has copy, drop {
    id: T,
    // true means the id is a reference in OrderContext, false means the id is a value
    is_ref: bool,
}
```

### Scope

The data conversion works for all data types in ./move/operations/*.move. A generic data conversion for move types is not within the scope of this project.

### How to get ABI

The ABI of the move structure can be obtained from deployed smart contracts on chain. Please refer to `src/index.ts` for details.

**Note**: When finishing the assignment, do not create a pull request for submission.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your system.

### Installation
To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

### Usage 

To run the script, execute the following command:

This will convert all move types in the ./move/operations/*.move directory to TypeScript types.
